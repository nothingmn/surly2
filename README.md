Surly2 is a half-complete node.js AIML interpreter with a bad attitude.

Surly2 is a remake from the ground up of [Surly](http://github.com/mrchimp/surly) using Node 5 and using as much asynchronicity as possible.


Status
======

Actually works quite well so far but not everything is implemented. Even so, I wouldn't try using it for anything serious quite yet. Check out `COVERAGE.md` for full details.


Requirements
============

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)


Installation
============

 1. Acquire code
 2. `npm install`


Config
======

Config files are found and read by [rc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc). Check the "Configuration File Formats" section of the `rc` readme for more instructions. Any flag shown in `node cli.js --help` can be set in the options file.

You probably just want to create `~/.surly2rc` and put something like this in it:

    {
        "brain": "/path/to/aiml/files",
        "username": "someXMPPUser@example.com",
        "password": "whatever"
    }


Usage
=====

1. `node cli.js`
2. Talk to Surly.
3. Type `exit` to exit.

Or chat over XMPP

1. Set up a config file (see above) with XMPP details `username`, `password`, `host` and `port`.
2. `node xmpp.js`
3. You can't add contacts yet. You'll have to do that yourself somehow.

Debugging
=========

Surly uses the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) npm package for debugging. E.g.

    DEBUG=surly2 node cli.js
